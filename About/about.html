                <p>The world is constantly subdued to change but never before has the pace of development been so rapid.
                    Society is continuously introduced to new technologies and it seems rather impossible to keep up to
                    date. Recently we have been introduced to Artificial Intelligence and its highly mysterious Neural
                    Networks. The time of tangible technology is long gone, but are we now entering an era where tech
                    obtains human properties? We are talking about "Intelligence" and "Neural Networks", words that
                    before have only been assigned to organisms. Somewhere behind all these seemingly natural layers,
                    the technical "DNA" is still computer code, written by us humans. Have we increased the distance to
                    society by mystifying these developments? Media tend to write about them and show their power rather
                    than to show their use. In the name of proper journalism, we must, therefore, familiarize ourselves
                    with their practice and communicate our habituation to you.

                    From our research into deepfakes we learned that there is a gap between what the media writes and
                    what is actually out there. The technology is portrayed as a great potential threat whilst the
                    internet is full of innocent amateur creations intended for fun. We have discovered that there are
                    many YouTube channels that create deepfakes of celebrities and movie fragments.
                    <br><br>
                    Yet, over 90 percent of the deepfakes are pornographic and certainly harmful to their targets, but
                    they are more or less acknowledged by their victims. The quality is often low and their context hard
                    to believe, these videos are commonly considered fake. Those who secretly peruse these sites might
                    merely desire to inspire their imagination rather than to hunt for realism. There is something we
                    can learn from the way society has accustomed to these outskirt videos. Their overwhelming presence
                    has enforced a resilience that our general civilization is still lacking.
                    <br><br>
                    The ability to manipulate still-images goes way back and today no one is concerned about Photoshop
                    anymore. Most people will name Photoshop when they encounter an image that is hard to believe. Those
                    who are familiar with the software have developed an eye for its traces and have an idea of its
                    affordances and constraints. We can say that society has shifted its trust from images to videos,
                    though technologies have caught up and our trust in information is challenged again.

                    As a reaction to this process we have created this website based on two goals: Bringing deepfake
                    technologies to the people. Providing people with the tools to recognize them. Just as photoshopped
                    images have become part of our culture we can re-adjust to the existence of deepfake technology. The
                    process of creating this website has been a journey for our team. The many deepfakes we have created
                    have put the technology into perspective. We have learned that the algorithm is a new tool that is
                    part of a bigger process. Making a deepfake is like dealing with a black box in the project, as if
                    you bring your footage away for a few days and afterwards receive raw material that you can turn
                    into a video. Overtime we developed a feeling for the impact of content characteristics and were
                    able to improve the quality of our results. Not only has our view of the technology become more
                    practical, but it has also shown its limits. By exposing our work and elaborating on our lessons we
                    want to give the visitor what this project has given to us.

                    Throughout this website, you will encounter a series of deepfakes that tell you the story of our
                    research. The deepfake videos introduce the visitor to the complexity of the algorithm and how its
                    functioning leaves traces on the output. By decomposing the process of creating a deepfake video and
                    showing how different variables impact the output quality, we intend to have our audience develop an
                    understanding of the technologyâ€™s real-world capabilities. In addition, we show the limits of the
                    algorithms and how this knowledge can be used to recognise deepfakes. Towards the end of the site,
                    the discussion will evolve along with an increase quality for deepfake samples. Each page contains a
                    set of icons that point out the points of recognition and a button that unfolds a technical
                    narrative including details about the video. There are also three experiments included in the
                    website that compare the different outcome for a single parameter change. At last, there are three
                    deepfake videos, which come straight from the internet, that relate to our previous research and
                    show what one can find online. From the overall experience, the visitor will familiarise oneself
                    with the technology in a similar way to working hands-on.

                    Will we also have to let go of our trust in video content? As we discuss, not all video content can
                    easily be deepfaked. Though, we do need to decentralise our trust and be very critical about our
                    sources and their context. Compared to the past we are much more connected and less dependant on a
                    single image or video. People have also been able to falsely 'verify' information via networks of
                    fake profiles. Some might remember Luka Magnotta who became famous for killing cats on the internet
                    (recently featured in a Netflix documentary). He was able to mislead his investigators by spreading
                    fake information via many fake profiles. Eventually, any progress will get caught up by
                    falsification therefore it is important to not alienate the technology and be able to recognize its
                    functioning.

                    This project was created as part of the final synthesis laboratory of the master's program in
                    Communication Design at Politecnico di Milano. Our different cultural backgrounds gave this website
                    a different taste, for that we all came from different worlds, Italians, Dutch, Argentinian,
                    Chinese, and Lebanese.
