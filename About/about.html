                <p>We all know the amount of devices connected to the internet is increasing. From a smartwatch to a
                    smart thermostat that communicates with your phone to know when you are home, more and more objects
                    are communicating to each other. Understandably, many people nowadays use to term Internet of things
                    or IoT, but what does this actually mean?

                    <br><br>Lisa El√©nius Taylor, head of IoT marketing for Ericsson, explained, "at the most basic
                    level, the Internet of Things is a network of devices, vehicles and appliances that have software
                    and connectivity capabilities". These "things" that can connect to a grid are able to exchange
                    information but in order to do so they need a name or an address recognised by all other members of
                    this grid. This address is a code called IP and in the infographic on this webpage it is shown how,
                    over the last decades, IPs spread over the world and how their current division is today.
